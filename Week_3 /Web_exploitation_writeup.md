The challenge says to login and there is a `Admin Login` page given. One of the inquiry in Support page says `Hi. I tried adding my favorite Irish person, Conan O'Brien. But I keep getting something called a SQL Error` .This tells us that the site uses a SQL database. Let's try the most basic SQL Injection: 


`Note`:  Password can be anything in both the cases…it doesn't matter

Method 1: 

Username: `' OR 1=1--`
Password = `123 `


Method 2: 


Username = `admin'--`
Password = `123 `



The SQL query that checks the login is likely something like:

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password';
```

When we put in our injection, the query becomes:


```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1--' AND password='123';
```

What is happening here is the query checks if the username is equal to nothing. Then, it checks OR 1=1. Since 1 is always going to be equal to 1, this returns true. The -- at the end simply comments out the rest of the query. This fools the server into letting us through the portal.



```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin'--' AND password='123';
```
What happened here is the query check if the username is equal to admin and since it does, the `--` comments rest of the query and won't check the password and simply get injected and give us the flag:)

This challenge will simply get injected with one of the methods of previous challenge. Simple put username as `admin'--` and password as whatever and get the flag :)

Now we are just given password field to input. Inspecting the page, we will find that there is more than one input, just that one of them is hidden and set to 0. Let's set it to 1 then we can actually see the query which we are inputting.
When we put the password as some random characters like `abcd` we will see password as `nopq` in the query. We can guess that this is some kind of substitution - `Caesar Cipher`.

This time, when we inject the same injection `' or 1=1--`, we get back our encrypted query:

```
password: ' or 1=1--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' be 1=1--'
```

The characters for the word `OR` are substituted for `BE`. We try our query again, this time following the encryption, as so: `' be 1=1--`. The portal lets us through, and we finally see our flag :)

Through the description and the hint, we can guess that it is a path traversal challenge. On viewing the source code of `Home` page , we will find a path named 
`secret/assets/index.css`. `secret` rings a bell, let's try traversing to `secret/assets/`..umm..nothing…let's try just `secret/` okay, we are on the right track. Again `view page source` and let's go to `secret/hidden/` and again viewing this page source code and going to  `secret/hidden/superhidden` we will get to our flag page. But we can't see it, again `View Page Source` and there we got our flag :)

Okay, we need some `Burpsuite` here to intercept the `request` and get the flag. Put some random details on `Registration` page and check the response on Burpsuite's `Repeater`, a `2fa authentication` page will be opened. Just then, intercept the `GET` request header to `POST` and get the flag :)
